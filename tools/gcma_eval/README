Evaluate gcma from user space

This directory contains source files and scripts for gcma evaluation from
user space.

Currently available evaluations(currently, only one...) are as following:

Success rate / latency
----------------------

1. Memory stress
Stress memory by randomly read / write 8MiB from every ramdomly selected
position of 2GiB file using 14 concurrent threads.

2. Success rate / latency evaluation
While `Memory stress` running in background, request 10 ~ 10000 contiguous
pages allocation and then release the pages using cma and gcma, compare their
success / fail count, time spend for allocation / failed allocation / release.
Do the allocation / release 10 times for each requesting size, compute average,
minimum, maximum times. Each allocation have term between them 1 seconds to
warm up memory.

Build
=====

Just do the command following:
$ make

Usage
=====

Ensure the debugfs is mounted
Start evaluation using following command:
$ ./eval.sh

You can see the result using following command:
$ cat /sys/kernel/debugfs/gcma_eval/res

TODO
====

Add more workloads, benchmarks
First of all, make linux build works with gcma enabled environment, measure the
performance.
