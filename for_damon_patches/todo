TODOs
=====

- Support pmem (already done?)
- Make debugfs interface simple and clean
 - Atomically pass a copy of constructed context to damon_start()?
- Avoid conflict between concurrent DAMON users
  There could be several strategy
  1. Unconditionally mutual exclusive
  2. Contitionally mutual exclusive
     Make only contexts from different users mutual exclusive: The user will
     make each of the context to not interfere somehow.

     How to determine whether contexts are requested by same user or not?
     1. Make group id concept
     2. Receive multiple contexts from the beginning
  3. Finest grained conflict check
     Ask users to specify more informations including

     1. Maximum address ranges it will monitor
     2. Type of the monitoring target (struct pid, paddr, ...)

     And judge conflicts as finest as we can.
- Optimize buffer writeback (Alkaid)
  - Reduce unnecessary open()/close()
  - Add 'O_LARGEFILE' in filp_open()

Done
