TODOs
=====

- Support pmem (already done?)
- Make debugfs interface simple and clean
 - Atomically pass a copy of constructed context to damon_start()?
- Minimize fixed granularity overhead
- Support cgroups
- Support multi contexts from user space
- Charge kdamond CPU usage to requesting user space process
  (Could kdamonds name distinguishments help this?)
- Separate code to multiple files
  - damon/core.c, primitives.c, dbgfs.c, fs.c
- damonfs: Support mkdir/rmdir (maybe we should write damonfs)
- damonfs: Export pid of kdamond via a file
- damo/wss: Adjust the nr_accesses for work_time


Done
====

- s/snprintf()/scnprintf() (Marco Elver)
- Let kdamonds from user space/kernel space distinguishable by the name
- Move unnecessarily global variable (debugfs_root) to local
- Move code to separate directory, mm/damon/
- Separate debugfs interface code from the framework
