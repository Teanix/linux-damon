TODOs
=====

- Export the functions for modules
- Add cleanup callback
- Do not generate 'null' when record is disabled
- Implement real 'min_nr_regions'
  Dynamically set max size of region based on this will also avoid the
  thunderings.
- Refine the DAMOS commit message for Breandan's questions (DAMOS alternatives
  and targets)
- Refine the functions export commit messages for Brendan's questions (what
  commit really require the changes?)
