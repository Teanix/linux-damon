TODOs
=====

- Export the functions for modules
- Add cleanup callback
- Do not generate 'null' when record is disabled
- Implement real 'min_nr_regions'
  Dynamically set max size of region based on this will also avoid the
  thunderings.
- Apply Varad's optimization


Done
====

- Export page_lock_anon_vma_read, rmap_walk, and page_rmapping for module build
- Refine the functions export commit messages for Brendan's questions (what
  commit really require the changes?)
- Refine the DAMOS commit message for Breandan's questions (DAMOS alternatives
  and targets)
