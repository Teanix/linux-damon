For accuracy improvement
========================

- Use LRU index of page as the address scheme
- On top of LRU index-as-an-address idea, we can move pages in LRU according to
  the hotness.  This even improves LRU itself.
- Cons of this idea is the fact that it cannot work for vaddr or paddr.
- How about having another address space for DAMON (translate vaddr or paddr
  into DAMON address) and moving pages in the DAMON-address-space?
